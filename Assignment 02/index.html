    <h3>SCENE 1: Boy Meets Boy</h3>

        for the day. As his feet hit the hard floor, he came face-to-face with
        his gym crush who was staring at him with a very puzzled expression.
        Shit, Tyson, thought. It must have been that loud groan he had let out
        at the tenth rep. His crush quickly caught himself and made to tear his
        eyes away from Tyson’s. But Tyson was not going to let him off this
        time. He was going to talk to the boy of his dreams.</i
      >
    </p>

    <p><strong>Tyson:</strong> <em>(rather shakily)</em> Hey</p>

    <p><strong> Crush:</strong> <em>(smiling shyly)</em> Hey</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tyson:</strong>
      <em>(now getting bold because his crush appears shy)</em>
      Do you want to do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Crush:</strong> Oh, no, I could never! I don’t have enough power
      in my stomach to pull that off. At least not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tyson:</strong> Well, you can start small. I can work with you on
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Crush:</strong> I’ll like that. But I came with somebody. He has a
      program for me and I’m just going to follow that for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tyson:</strong> Fair enough. But if you ever change your mind… or
      want to have a taste of something new, I’m here for you!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Crush:</strong> Ooooooooh, a blank cheque… I like!</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tyson:</strong>
      <em>(extends his right hand to his Crush)</em> Yeah. I’m Tyson, by the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Crush:</strong> <em>(gives Tyson’s extended hand a shake)</em> I
      am Opeoluwa Treasure Oladimeji Fakayode.
    </p>

    <h3>SCENE 2: Wait, what?</h3>

    <p><strong>Kiwi:</strong> No. You. Didn’t!</p>

    <p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Stop it.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kiwi:</strong> Stop what? Am I the one who opened your mouth and
      gave him your government name?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Treasure:</strong> See, it’s almost 9pm. We should be going home
      soon. Let’s get serious. We still have three leg programmes to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kiwi:</strong> Okay o. Brother Opeoluwa Treasure Oladimeji
      Fakayode. >
    </p>

    <h3>SCENE 3: Wow, that happened!</h3>

    <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> Are you still blushing?</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tyson:</strong> I can’t help it. I like that gu.y I
      <em>reeeeeeeeeeally</em> like that guy!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Marcus:</strong> Well, at least you finally summoned up courage to
      talk to him. What is he like, though?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tyson:</strong> I think he was shy. I think he’s into me too.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Marcus:</strong> I think you’re thinking the things you want to
      see.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tyson:</strong> Wow, ten points for captain obvious!</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Marcus:</strong> Ha ha. Very funny. Maybe I should drive home
      alone and give you some time to, you know, explore your newfound funny
      nature while trekking after me.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tyson:</strong> Sorry ma.</p>

    <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> Better!</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tyson:</strong> But Marcus, I really like this guy o. How do I
      proceed with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Marcus:</strong> Well, say hi to him when we get home. Like, start
      a conversation on WhatsApp.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tyson:</strong> Hehehehehehehehehehehe.</p>

    <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> What? You didn’t get his number?</p>
    <p><strong>Tyson:</strong> Hehehehehehehehehehehe.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Marcus:</strong> You really aren’t learning anything from me, are
      you?
